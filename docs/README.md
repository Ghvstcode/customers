**Purpose** | **[Running](../README.md#running-locally)** | **[Configuration](./config.md)**

### Purpose

The Customers project focuses on solving authentic identification of humans who are legally able to hold and transfer currency within the US. Primarily this project solves [Know Your Customer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) (KYC), [Customer Identification Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Identification_Program) (CIP), [Office of Foreign Asset Control](https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx) (OFAC) checks and verification workflows to comply with US federal law and ensure authentic transfers. Also, Customers has an objective to be a service for detailed due diligence on individuals and companies for Financial Institutions and services in a modernized and extensible way.

## Models

Moov Customers has several models which are used throughout the HTTP endpoints. These are generated from the OpenAPI specification in the `github.com/moov-io/customers/pkg/client` Go package.

### Customer

`Customer` represents an individual or business (Sole-Proprietorships or Corporation). The data required for each will change with version v0.5.0 of Customers. See the [API documentation](https://moov-io.github.io/customers/#post-/customers) for creating a Customer.

### Account

`Account` represents a demand-deposit account at a financial institution. The account number is encrypted. See the [API documentation](https://moov-io.github.io/customers/#post-/customers/{customerID}/accounts) for creating an Account.

#### Account Validation

In order to use a new account for ACH transactions, it will need to be validated. Moov Customers supports following strategies that can be used for account validation:

* micro-deposits - typically two deposits of less than $0.50 are transferred to customer's bank account and then customer providing deposits amounts as verification
* instant - some vendors like Plaid, MX, Yodelee provide the ability to verify customer's bank account instantly using their online banking credentials

See more information on [how account validation strategies work](./account-validation.md).
