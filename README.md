## Project Status

Moov Customers is under active development, so please star the project if you are interested in its progress. We are developing an extensible HTTP API for interactions along with an OpenAPI specification file for generating clients for integration projects.

## Getting Started

Customers has a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) setup which you can run locally. This uses the latest releases of Customers and Watchman.

```
$ docker-compose up
Creating customers_watchman_1 ... done
Creating customers_customers_1 ... done
...
customers_1  | ts=2020-03-06T22:56:24.2184402Z caller=main.go:50 startup="Starting moov-io/customers server version v0.4.0-rc1"
customers_1  | ts=2020-03-06T22:56:24.393462Z caller=watchman.go:102 watchman="using http://watchman:8084 for Watchman address"
customers_1  | ts=2020-03-06T22:56:24.3951132Z caller=main.go:171 startup="binding to :8087 for HTTP server"
```

Once the systems start you can access Customers via `http://localhost:8087` and Watchman's [web interface or api](http://localhost:8084):

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is a good candidate for new contributors while also allowing the project to move more quickly by reducing regressions issues that might not be caught before a release is pushed out to our users. One great way to improve coverage is by adding edge cases and different inputs to functions.
